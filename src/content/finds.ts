The article argues that software isn't just a tool — it's culture, shaped by and shaping the people who use it.",

    expandedNote: "Susan Kare is the iconographer who designed the first icons for Apple's Mac — making computers feel friendly and human. Working with Steve Jobs in the early 1980s, she created pixel-perfect icons on a 32×32 grid that became the visual language of personal computing: the Happy Mac, the paintbrush, the trash can, the command key symbol (⌘). Her presentation is a joy to watch — she walks through her process with warmth and humor. She even mentioned a book called \"Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art\" by Scott McCloud, which went straight to my read list. What strikes me most is how she proved that constraints (tiny grids, limited pixels) don't limit creativity — they focus it.",
